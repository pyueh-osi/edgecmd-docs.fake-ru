# Configuration
Use EdgeCmd utility to configure an adapter or adapter components directly from the command line or by pointing to a JSON file that contains the configuration. For more information about the specific configurations, see the Edge Data Store documentation.

You can also configure Edge Data Store using any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls. Use EdgeCmd utility to make one-off changes; use REST APIs to configure multiple systems the same way programmatically.

# EdgeCmd utility

Use OSIsoft's proprietary tool, EdgeCmd utility, to configure and administer PI adapters on Linux and Windows using command line arguments. Because EdgeCmd utility is a command line tool, you can make adjustments to the configuration on the fly without programming. If you prefer, you can perform all tasks available in EdgeCmd utility using REST APIs. Use EdgeCmd utility to make one-off changes; use REST APIs to configure multiple systems the same way programmatically.

**Note:** Configuration and administrative REST interfaces are generally exposed through the command line.
